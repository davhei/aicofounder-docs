Brainstorming is for when you don't have an idea yet. Instead of generating ideas in a vacuum, aicofounder finds real problems that real people are talking about in online communities and brings them to you as starting points.

The premise is simple: the best products solve problems people already have. So rather than asking "what should I build?", brainstorming starts with "what are people struggling with?"

## How it works

When you start a project without a clear idea, your AI cofounder asks about the industries or areas you're interested in. Based on your answer, it identifies relevant online communities where people in that space discuss their work, frustrations, and needs.

It then collects recent posts from those communities and deploys agents to analyze them. These agents are looking for something specific: posts where someone describes a real problem they personally experience. Not opinions, not questions, not general discussions. First-person accounts of actual pain points, especially ones that affect business outcomes, cost time or money, or come up repeatedly.

From hundreds of collected posts, the agents typically surface a few dozen that contain genuine, specific problems worth considering. Your AI cofounder then walks you through the most promising ones, discussing what each problem really means, who experiences it, and what a solution might look like.

## Why real problems matter

Most brainstorming produces ideas that sound good in theory but don't connect to anything real. You might come up with something clever, but then spend weeks discovering that nobody actually wants it.

Starting from documented problems inverts this. Every idea that comes out of the process is grounded in something a real person said they struggle with. You can read their words, understand their context, and see how others in the community responded. This doesn't guarantee a viable product, but it means you're starting from evidence rather than speculation.

The agents are deliberately strict in what they surface. They reject posts that are just venting without describing a specific problem, posts asking general questions, and posts discussing problems abstractly rather than from personal experience. What remains are posts where someone is describing a concrete situation they need help with. These are the raw material for good product ideas.

## From problems to ideas

Once your AI cofounder surfaces interesting problems, the conversation shifts to evaluation. Together you discuss which problems seem most promising based on factors like how frequently they appear, how painful they seem, whether existing solutions address them adequately, and whether they align with your skills and interests.

This isn't a one-way presentation. Your AI cofounder challenges assumptions, points out things you might be overlooking, and helps you think through whether a problem is actually as significant as it appears. The goal is to move from a broad set of real problems to one or two that are worth investigating further, at which point you can use deep research to go deeper.

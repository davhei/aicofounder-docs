Documents are the primary way information is captured and organized on the canvas. As you work with your AI cofounder, documents accumulate to form a comprehensive picture of what you're building: the decisions you've made, what you've learned, and where things are headed.

Unlike chat messages that scroll by and fade from view, documents persist. They get updated as your understanding evolves, and they serve as the source of truth for your project.

## What documents capture

Documents cover everything substantive about your product. Some examples:

- **Product overview** - what you're building, who it's for, what problem it solves
- **Feature specs** - how specific features work, user flows, edge cases
- **Competitor analysis** - who else is in the space, how they compare, gaps in the market
- **Research findings** - market insights, user needs, industry trends
- **Branding** - colors, typography, tone of voice
- **Regulations** - permits, compliance requirements, legal considerations
- **Sourcing and manufacturing** - suppliers, costs, minimum order quantities

Your AI cofounder creates documents as you work through problems together. When information is confirmed in conversation, it gets captured in a document so it's not lost. You can also create documents yourself using the + button at the bottom of the canvas.

## Editing documents

Click a document once to select it, which reveals the toolbar. Click again to start editing.

The toolbar gives you access to formatting options:

- **Text styles** - normal text and four heading levels
- **Basic formatting** - bold, italic, strikethrough
- **Lists** - bullet lists, numbered lists, and task lists with checkboxes
- **Code** - inline code and code blocks
- **Other** - blockquotes, horizontal rules, tables

Documents support full markdown, so you can also type markdown syntax directly if you prefer.

Changes save automatically as you type.

## Collapse and fullscreen

Documents can be collapsed to show just a preview, which helps keep the canvas manageable when you have many documents. Click the collapse button in the document header to toggle between collapsed and expanded views.

For focused editing, open a document in fullscreen. This gives you a clean, distraction-free view with the full toolbar. Fullscreen is particularly useful for longer documents where you want to concentrate on the content without the rest of the canvas visible.

## Resizing

Drag the left or right edge of a document to adjust its width. This lets you make documents narrower to fit more on the canvas, or wider for content like tables that benefits from more horizontal space.

## Research documents

When your AI cofounder completes a research task, the findings are saved as a document on the canvas. Research documents include inline citations that link back to sources.

Citations appear as small tags within the text. Hover over a citation to see the page title and source, or click to open the original page. This lets you verify findings or dig deeper into a particular source.

## The plan document

The plan is a special document that serves as your project's roadmap. It captures the current constraint blocking progress, the active phase to overcome it, and sketches of future phases.

The plan uses task lists to track what needs to happen:

```
- [x] Completed task
- [ ] Task still to do
```

As tasks complete, they get checked off. The plan evolves as phases complete and new constraints emerge.

The plan document is created through ultraplanning and has a distinct compass icon to set it apart from regular documents. See the [ultraplan](/ultraplan) page for more on how planning works.

## How the AI works with documents

Your AI cofounder treats the canvas as the project's source of truth. As you discuss ideas and make decisions in chat, confirmed information gets written to documents.

Documents aren't static. As your understanding of the market shifts or early assumptions get invalidated, your AI cofounder updates what's on the canvas to match. Outdated information gets removed or revised so documents always reflect the current state of thinking.

The approach favors multiple focused documents over consolidating into fewer long ones. A document on competitor pricing, a document on your target user, a document on technical requirements. This keeps information organized and easy to find.

## Downloading

Export any document in the format you need:

- **Word** (.docx) - for sharing with others or further editing
- **PDF** - for polished, shareable versions
- **Text** (.txt) - plain text without formatting
- **Markdown** (.md) - preserves formatting in markdown syntax

Access download options from the document menu.

Everything you create in aicofounder is yours. You can export documents, notes, websites, and content calendar posts at any time in multiple formats.

## Exporting the canvas

To download everything at once, click the Export button in the topbar. Choose a format and you'll get a ZIP file containing:

- `/documents/` - all your documents
- `/notes/` - all your notes
- `/websites/` - each website in its own folder
- `/content-calendar/` - all your scheduled posts

The format you choose (Word, PDF, Text, or Markdown) applies to documents, notes, and content calendar posts. Websites are always exported as code.

## Exporting documents

To export a single document, open it in fullscreen and click the menu icon in the top right. Select Download and choose a format:

- **Word** (.docx) - for editing in Microsoft Word or Google Docs
- **PDF** - for sharing or printing
- **Text** (.txt) - plain text without formatting
- **Markdown** (.md) - preserves formatting for use in other tools

Citations in research documents are converted to regular links. Images are not included in exports.

## Exporting notes

Notes can be exported the same way as documents. Click the note to select it, open the menu, and choose Download. The same four formats are available.

## Exporting websites

Website exports give you production-ready code you can host anywhere.

From the fullscreen website view, click the menu and select Download. You have two options:

**Website** (.zip) downloads all your website's code files. The CSS is optimized for production, and a README is included with deployment instructions for Netlify, Vercel, and GitHub Pages. See [publishing](/publishing) for hosting through aicofounder. You can open index.html directly in a browser or upload the files to any hosting service.

**Emails** (.csv) downloads all captured email addresses with timestamps. Use this to import subscribers into your email marketing tool.

## Exporting the content calendar

You can export the entire content calendar or individual posts.

**All posts**: Click the content calendar card on the canvas to select it, open the menu, and choose Download. Select a format and you'll get a ZIP file with one file per post.

**Single post**: Open a post in fullscreen and use the Download option in the menu. Each export includes the platform, scheduled time, and content. Reddit posts include the subreddit.

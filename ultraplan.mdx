Ultraplan is how aicofounder does strategic planning. It's a dedicated planning agent that assesses the current state of your project, identifies the single most important thing blocking progress, and creates a specific plan to address it.

It's not a product roadmap or a generic startup checklist. Ultraplan looks at what actually exists in your project right now and figures out what needs to happen next.

## Why constraint-focused planning

Most planning tools try to map out the entire journey from idea to launch. The problem is that detailed plans for later stages are almost always wrong, because the situation changes as you learn more. You end up spending time planning things that won't happen the way you expected.

Ultraplan takes a different approach based on a simple insight: at any point in a project, exactly one constraint limits progress more than all others. Working on anything else before addressing that constraint is wasted effort. A clothing brand can't optimize their store conversion if they haven't validated their designs. A software product can't build distribution if the core user problem isn't clear.

So instead of planning everything, ultraplan focuses entirely on finding that one constraint and creating a plan to break it. The current phase gets detailed, actionable tasks. Future phases get directional sketches that will be revisited when the constraint shifts.

## How it works

When your AI cofounder needs to do strategic planning, it calls the ultraplan agent. This happens at key moments: when starting a new project, after a phase completes, when research changes the picture, or when you hit an unexpected blocker.

The ultraplan agent reads your entire canvas to understand the current state of the project. It looks at what documents exist, what's been validated versus assumed, what research has been done, and where things stand. Then it works through a structured process:

1. **Assess the current state.** What actually exists? What's been validated? What's still an assumption? Ultraplan is honest about what's known versus what's hoped for.

2. **Identify the constraint.** Not just what feels like the biggest problem, but what's actually blocking progress. It asks diagnostic questions: What would need to be true for this project to succeed? Which assumption has the least evidence? Which, if wrong, makes everything else irrelevant? Is this the root cause or a symptom of something deeper?

3. **Plan the current phase.** A detailed plan with a clear objective, specific tasks, completion criteria, and risks. Each task specifies what needs to be done, what it produces, and how it contributes to breaking the constraint.

4. **Sketch future phases.** One or two sentences about what likely comes next, without detailed planning. These sketches exist for directional awareness, not commitment.

## The plan document

The output of ultraplanning becomes the plan document on your canvas. This is a living document with a compass icon that serves as your project's roadmap. It contains:

- The identified constraint and why it matters
- The current phase objective and completion criteria
- Tasks with checkboxes that you and your AI cofounder work through together
- High-level sketches of future phases

You can check off tasks directly on the canvas as they're completed. Your AI cofounder also checks off tasks as you work through them together in chat.

## A collaborative process

Ultraplan produces recommendations, not mandates. After ultraplanning completes, your AI cofounder walks you through the results: what constraint was identified, the proposed phase, and the specific tasks. You discuss it, add context the AI might not have, and agree on the plan before anything is committed to the plan document.

This matters because you often have information that isn't captured on the canvas. Maybe you've had conversations with potential customers, or you know something about your market that changes the picture. The plan should reflect what you both know, not just what the AI can see.

## When ultraplanning happens

Ultraplan runs at natural inflection points in your project:

- **New projects.** After your AI cofounder gathers initial context about what you're building and who it's for, it ultraplans to create the first phase.
- **Phase completion.** When all tasks in the current phase are done or the completion criteria are met, ultraplan reassesses with fresh eyes. The constraint has likely shifted.
- **After research.** When deep research produces findings that change the picture, ultraplan incorporates the new information.
- **When things change.** New information, a pivot, an unexpected blocker. Anything that might shift the constraint is a reason to replan.

Each time ultraplan runs, it reassesses the situation from scratch rather than building on the previous plan. Constraints shift as phases complete, and the plan should always reflect reality as it currently exists.

## What makes a good phase plan

A well-designed ultraplan phase has a few key properties:

- **A clear objective.** One phase, one focus. What specific question are you answering or capability are you creating?
- **Observable completion criteria.** Not "feel confident about the market" but "have evidence from research and customer conversations showing whether the problem is real and who experiences it most."
- **Only necessary tasks.** Everything in the plan directly contributes to breaking the constraint. No busywork.
- **Tasks you work through together.** Your AI cofounder guides you through each task, even ones that require your direct involvement like customer conversations or business decisions.
- **Acknowledgment of risks.** What could go wrong, and what's the fallback if a key task produces unexpected results.

Phases are kept as short as possible while still being meaningful. Shorter phases mean faster reassessment and more chances to course-correct.

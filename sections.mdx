Sections are colored areas for visually organizing your canvas. Use them to group related documents, notes, and other items together.

Sections are purely for your own organization. Your AI cofounder doesn't create sections or see them, so arrange things however makes sense to you.

## Creating sections

There are two ways to create a section:

**From multi-select.** Click and drag on an empty area of the canvas to draw a selection box around multiple items. The selection toolbar appears with a button to create a section around them.

**From an item toolbar.** Select any document or note, and you'll see a section button in its toolbar. This creates a section sized to fit that item.

## Naming sections

Each section has a name displayed as a tab above it. Click the name to edit it. Use names that help you remember what the group is for, like "Research", "Branding", or "Phase 1".

## Colors

Sections come in seven colors: yellow, green, peach, pink, blue, purple, and teal. Click a section to select it, then use the color picker in the toolbar to change its color.

Use colors however you like. You might color-code by topic, by status, or just to make the canvas easier to scan visually.

## Resizing

Drag any edge or corner of a section to resize it. Sections can be resized in all directions, unlike documents and notes which only resize horizontally.

## Moving sections

Drag a section to move it. Everything inside the section moves together, making it easy to reorganize entire groups of items at once.

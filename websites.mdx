Websites let you create landing pages, marketing sites, and web apps directly within your project. Whether you're validating an idea with a simple landing page or building something more substantial, your AI cofounder can design and build the site for you.

Your AI cofounder creates websites as part of working on your project. You can also create a website yourself using the + button at the bottom of the canvas. Websites appear as thumbnail cards on the canvas, and clicking one opens the fullscreen website builder.

## How the AI designs websites

When building a website, your AI cofounder aims for distinctive, production-grade design rather than generic templates. Each site gets a specific aesthetic direction based on what you're building and who it's for. Typography, color, layout, and motion are all considered to create something memorable rather than cookie-cutter.

If you have specific design preferences, share them. Reference sites you like, describe the feel you're going for, or provide brand colors. The more context you give, the better the result.

## The website builder

The fullscreen website builder has three views, accessible from the toggle in the top left.

**Preview** shows a live rendering of your website. Use the URL bar to navigate between pages. Links within the preview work, so you can click through the site as a visitor would.

**Code** shows the file tree, open tabs, and a code editor. You can browse the files that make up your website and see how everything is structured. Editing code requires a Pro plan; free users can view but not modify.

**Emails** shows email addresses captured through your website's signup forms. More on this below.

## Providing images and assets

When you need specific images or videos in your website, provide them to your AI cofounder. You can share URLs or upload files directly to the chat. The AI will incorporate them into the site.

For placeholder situations, the AI uses CSS backgrounds, gradients, or patterns until you provide the real assets.

## Email capture

Websites have a built-in email capture system. When your AI cofounder builds a signup form, it connects to an endpoint that stores submissions automatically.

Captured emails appear in the Emails view of the website builder. You can see when each email was submitted and export the full list as a CSV file.

Note that email capture only works on the published website, not in the preview. This is due to browser security restrictions.

## Downloading

From the website menu, you can download:

- **Website** (.zip) - all the code files, ready to host elsewhere if needed
- **Emails** (.csv) - the list of captured email addresses

## Next steps

Once your website is ready, see [publishing](/publishing) to make it live with your own subdomain or custom domain.

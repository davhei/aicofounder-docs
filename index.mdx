# Welcome to aicofounder

aicofounder is an AI cofounder for solo founders and small teams. It helps you research, plan, and build products people actually want, whether that's an app, a physical product, a service, or any other type of business.

Rather than waiting for you to figure out what to do next, aicofounder leads the process. It plans strategically, researches deeply, and builds alongside you on a shared canvas workspace.

## What you can do

- **Research**: AI agents search the web and online communities to produce detailed, cited reports
- **Plan**: ultraplanning identifies what's blocking your project and creates a phased plan to move forward
- **Build**: create documents, websites, and marketing content directly on your canvas
- **Publish**: host websites with custom domains and capture emails
- **Collaborate**: invite your team to work on projects together

## Getting started

1. **Create an account** at [aicofounder.com](https://aicofounder.com/signup)
2. **Start a new project** from your dashboard
3. **Describe what you want to build** and your AI cofounder takes it from there

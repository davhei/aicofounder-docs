Deep research is aicofounder's multi-agent research system. Instead of a single AI doing a few web searches, deep research deploys a team of AI agents that work in parallel to search the web and online communities, then synthesizes their findings into a detailed report with citations.

It's designed for questions that need real depth: understanding a market, evaluating competitors, figuring out regulations for a specific business, sourcing options for a physical product, or exploring a technical domain you're unfamiliar with.

## How it works

When your AI cofounder determines that a question needs thorough research, it proposes a research task. You'll see a summary of what it plans to investigate and can choose to approve or skip.

Once approved, the system works in three stages:

1. **A lead agent plans the research.** It analyzes your question, determines whether it needs depth (multiple perspectives on one topic), breadth (many distinct sub-questions), or a focused investigation, and creates a research plan.

2. **Subagents research in parallel.** The lead agent delegates specific tasks to specialized subagents. Each subagent independently searches the web and Reddit, reads pages, evaluates source quality, and compiles its findings. Depending on the complexity of your question, anywhere from 1 to 20 subagents may run simultaneously.

3. **The lead agent writes the final report.** Once the subagents complete their work, the lead agent reviews all findings, resolves any conflicting information, and writes a comprehensive report. A separate citations agent then verifies claims against source material and adds inline citations throughout the report.

You can watch the process in real time. Each subagent shows its current status and the sources it has found as it works.

## When to use deep research

Your AI cofounder has access to both quick web searches and deep research, and will choose the right tool based on your question.

**Quick web search** is used for simple lookups: checking a competitor's pricing, verifying a fact, or looking up what a term means.

**Deep research** is used when a question requires real exploration. Some examples:

- Comprehensive competitor analysis across an industry
- Understanding the regulatory landscape for a specific business in a specific location
- Evaluating sourcing and manufacturing options for a physical product
- Mapping out a market to understand who the players are and where the gaps exist
- Exploring a technical domain to inform architecture decisions

You don't need to explicitly ask for deep research. Your AI cofounder will propose it when it determines the question warrants that level of investigation. That said, you can always ask for research on a specific topic and it will initiate the process.

## The approval flow

Deep research uses more credits than a regular message because of the number of AI agents involved. Before research begins, you'll see a card with:

- A description of what the AI plans to research
- **Approve** to start the research
- **Skip** to continue the conversation without researching

This gives you control over when credits are spent on research. Deep research is available on Pro and Pro+ plans.

## Working with research findings

When research completes, the report is added to your conversation as a detailed, cited document. Citations appear inline so you can verify specific claims against their sources.

Your AI cofounder will then synthesize the key findings, explain what they mean for your project, and suggest a concrete next step. Research findings often lead to new documents on the canvas capturing the important takeaways, or inform decisions about what to build, how to position your product, or what to investigate next.

Each research task is focused on one specific topic. If a report surfaces something that needs deeper investigation, your AI cofounder will propose a follow-up research task focused on that area rather than trying to cover everything at once.

## How credits work

Credits reflect the AI processing required for each task. Different tasks use different amounts—a simple back-and-forth message uses fewer credits than deep research or ultraplanning, which process more information and take longer to complete.

Your credit balance updates in real-time as you work. You can see your current balance on the dashboard. Hover over it to see your plan details and when your credits reset.

## Monthly reset

Credits reset on your signup anniversary each month. If you signed up on the 15th, your credits reset to your plan amount on the 15th of each month.

Pro and Pro+ subscribers keep unused credits—they roll over to the next month instead of disappearing. Free plan credits do not roll over.

## Buying additional credits

Pro and Pro+ subscribers can purchase additional credits anytime. Credit packages are available in four sizes:

| Credits | Price |
|---------|-------|
| 100 | $25 |
| 200 | $50 |
| 500 | $125 |
| 1000 | $250 |

Pro+ subscribers receive 20% off all credit purchases.

To buy credits, hover over your credit balance on the dashboard and select **Add credits**. Purchased credits roll over for one month.

## Referral program

Invite friends to aicofounder and you both get 10 credits. Share your personal referral link—when someone signs up using it, they receive 10 credits immediately. You receive 10 credits once they start using the platform.

To find your referral link, click **Share with a friend** in the dashboard sidebar. You can copy the link or send an email invitation directly. The referral panel shows how many people you've referred and how many credits you've earned.

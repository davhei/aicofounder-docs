Privacy mode controls whether your project data can be accessed internally or used to improve the platform. When enabled, your data is excluded from internal review and analytics.

## What privacy mode does

With privacy mode enabled:

- **No internal access.** Your chats, documents, and project contents are not viewable by the aicofounder team. Admin tools return "access denied" for privacy mode accounts.
- **No platform improvement.** Your data is not used to analyze usage patterns or improve the product.
- **Excluded from analytics.** Your account is excluded from internal metrics and cohort analysis.

Privacy mode applies to your entire account and all projects within it.

## How AI providers handle your data

Your conversations are processed by third-party AI providers to generate responses. These providers operate under API terms that differ from their consumer products:

- **No training on API data.** Industry-standard API agreements specify that inputs and outputs are not used for model training.
- **Limited retention.** Data is typically retained for approximately 30 days for trust and safety purposes, then deleted.
- **No human review.** API data is not reviewed by provider staff except when required to investigate policy violations.

This is standard practice for commercial AI APIs and applies regardless of your privacy mode setting.

## Enabling privacy mode

**During signup:** The onboarding screen includes a privacy mode toggle. Enable it before creating your account.

**In settings:** Go to Settings and find the Data preferences section. Toggle privacy mode on or off at any time.

Changes take effect immediately.

## Security

All project data is encrypted in transit and at rest, regardless of privacy mode. Privacy mode controls access and usage policies, not the underlying security measures which apply to all accounts.

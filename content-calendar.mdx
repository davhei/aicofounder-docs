The content calendar helps you plan and organize content for social media and email. Your AI cofounder writes platform-appropriate content based on your project, and you publish it manually when you're ready.

Your AI cofounder creates content calendar posts as part of working on your project. You can also create posts yourself using the + button at the bottom of the canvas. The content calendar appears as a card on the canvas, and clicking it opens the fullscreen calendar view.

## Platforms

The content calendar supports four platforms:

- **LinkedIn** - professional posts for business networking
- **X** - concise posts optimized for engagement
- **Reddit** - community-focused posts for relevant subreddits
- **Email** - newsletters and updates for your subscriber list

Each platform has its own conventions and character limits. When your AI cofounder writes content, it adapts the tone and format to fit each platform naturally.

## The calendar view

The calendar shows a week at a time, with days running Sunday through Saturday. Each day displays any posts scheduled for that date, showing the platform icon and a preview of the content.

Use the navigation arrows to move between weeks. This lets you plan content in advance and see what's coming up.

## Creating content

When you discuss content strategy with your AI cofounder, it creates posts tailored to your project and audience. The AI considers:

- What you're building and who it's for
- The platform's conventions and audience expectations
- Your brand voice and messaging
- Current phase of your project (launch, growth, etc.)

You can request specific topics, ask for variations, or have the AI suggest a content schedule based on your goals.

## Viewing and editing posts

Click any post in the calendar to open the fullscreen view. This shows a realistic preview of how your post will look on its platform, complete with your profile info and formatting.

From here you can review the content, make edits, or ask your AI cofounder to revise it. The preview helps you see exactly what followers will see before you publish.

## Publishing

Posts are not published automatically. The content calendar is for planning and drafting. When you're ready to publish:

1. Open the post in fullscreen view
2. Copy the content
3. Paste it into the actual platform (LinkedIn, X, Reddit, or your email tool)

This manual approach gives you full control over timing and lets you make last-minute adjustments. It also means you don't need to connect your social accounts.

## Downloading

From the fullscreen post view, you can download content in several formats:

- **Word** (.docx) - for editing in Microsoft Word or Google Docs
- **PDF** - for sharing or archiving
- **Text** (.txt) - plain text for easy copying
- **Markdown** (.md) - for use in other tools

This is useful for keeping records, sharing drafts with collaborators, or repurposing content elsewhere. See [export](/export) for more ways to download your work.
